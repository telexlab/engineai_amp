## QUICKSTART

### 1. Create a Conda Environment

Create and activate a new environment with Python 3.11:

  ```bash
  conda create -n engineai_lab python=3.11
  conda activate engineai_lab
  ```

### 2. Install Prerequisites

- **Install Isaac Sim**

  Follow the official installation guide: [Isaac Lab - Pip Installation](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/pip_installation.html#installing-dependencies).

    *Since you've already created the engineai_lab environment, follow the guide from "Installing Dependencies" up to (but not including) the "Installing Isaac Lab" section.*

- **Clone & Setup Isaac Lab**

  Clone the repository and switch to the recommended branch:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
  cd IsaacLab
  git checkout 4df6560e
  ./isaaclab -i rsl_rl   # Install rsl-rl dependency
  ```

We highly recommend using the main branch`(4df6560e)` of Isaac Lab, as it can support rsl-rl-lib >= 5.0 and Isaac Sim >= 5.0 .

### 3. Install this Package

Once the prerequisites are set up, install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Supported Robots

This repository currently supports the following environments from the EngineAI Robots family:

|Robot| Task |Description|
|--------|--------|--------|
PM01|`Flat-PM01-v0`|Basic flat-terrain locomotion
PM01|`Flat-AMP-PM01-v0`|AMP-based motion imitation on flat terrain

*More robots and environments are coming soon!*

### Training a Policy

```
 python scripts/train.py --task=Flat-PM01-v0  --num_envs 4096 --headless --run_name <name>  
 python scripts/play.py  --task=Flat-PM01-v0 --num_envs 128 --load_run <name> 
```

### Evaluating a Policy

```
 python scripts/train.py --task=Flat-AMP-PM01-v0  --num_envs 4096 --headless --run_name <name> 
 python scripts/play.py --task=Flat-AMP-PM01-v0 --num_envs 128 --load_run <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with the name of your training run (found in logs/rsl_rl/).

### Deployment

To deploy a trained policy on real hardware, convert it to the MNN format for efficient inference.

#### 1. Export PyTorch Policy to ONNX

(Ensure your training script supports ONNX export)

#### 2. Build [MNN-Converter](https://mnn-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/quickstart_cpp.html?highlight=mnn+converter)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/mnn
cd mnn
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DMNN_BUILD_CONVERTER=ON
make -j8
```

#### 3. Convert ONNX into MNN

```bash
./MNNConvert -f ONNX \
  --modelFile path_to_your_policy.onnx \
  --MNNModel your_policy.mnn \
  --bizCode MNN
```
